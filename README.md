# Scalable Generation of Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images via Whole-Slide Flow Matching

This is our PyTorch implementation for the paper:

> Tinglin Huang, Tianyu Liu, Mehrtash Babadi, Wengong Jin, and Rex Ying (2025). Scalable Generation of Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images via Whole-Slide Flow Matching. Paper in [arxiv]().

We recently extended STFlow and released **STPath**, a generative pretrained model capable of directly predicting the expression levels of 38,984 genes from histology images without further fine-tuning. Feel free to check out the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.19.649665v2.abstract) and [code](https://github.com/Graph-and-Geometric-Learning/STPath), which includes an easy-to-use API.

# Usage

We are currently cleaning and organizing the codebase and will release it soon.
